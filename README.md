### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Alex, an iOS / tvOS developer from Scotland.

I've worked on iOS apps since the launch of the App Store in 2008; I've made a [lightsaber app](https://blog.alex.jsp.scot/2018/07/love-lightsabers-and-10-years-of-the-app-store), a unit conversion app, a 3rd party YouTube app, and much much more.

I currently work as the Engineering Manager of the Apple team at [Plex](http://plex.tv) helping to make our iOS and Apple TV apps awesome.

If you wanna chat you can reach out on [Mastodon @alexjsp@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@alexjsp) or if absolutely necessary [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexjsp).
