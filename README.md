### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Alex, an iOS / tvOS developer from Scotland.

I've worked on iOS apps since the launch of the App Store in 2008; I've made a [lightsaber app](https://medium.com/@alexstevensonprice/love-lightsabers-and-10-years-of-the-app-store-8537f8eb09d5), a unit conversion app, a 3rd party YouTube app, and much much more.

I currently work as the Engineering Manager of the Apple team at [Plex](http://plex.tv) helping to make our iOS and Apple TV apps awesome.

If you wanna chat you can reach out on [Twitter @alexjprice](https://twitter.com/alexjprice) or if absolutely necessary [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexjprice).
