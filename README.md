### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex, an iOS / tvOS developer from Scotland.

I've worked on iOS apps since the launch of the App Store in 2008; I've made [lightsaber apps](https://medium.com/@alexstevensonprice/love-lightsabers-and-10-years-of-the-app-store-8537f8eb09d5), Unit conversion apps, 3rd party YouTube apps, and much much more.

I currently work at [Plex](http://plex.tv) helping to make our iOS and Apple TV apps awesome.
